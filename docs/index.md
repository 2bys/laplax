# `laplax`

> Laplace Approximation in JAX.

The `laplax` package aims to provide a performant, minimal, and practical implementation of Laplace approximation techniques in [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax). This package is designed to support a wide range of scientific libraries, initially focusing on compatibility with popular neural network libraries such as [`equinox`](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), [`flax.linen`](https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/flax/linen), and [`flax.nnx`](https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/flax/nnx). Our goal is to create a flexible tool for both practical applications and research, enabling rapid iteration and comparison of new approaches.

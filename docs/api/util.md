# Utilities Module

The utilities module provides core functionality used throughout the library, from PyTree operations to matrix-vector products and data loading.

## Overview

### PyTree Operations
The tree utilities provide comprehensive functionality for:

- **Basic Operations:** Add, subtract, multiply, and other mathematical operations on PyTrees
- **Statistical Functions:** Mean, variance, covariance computations for PyTree structures
- **Array Creation:** Generate ones, zeros, random numbers in PyTree format
- **Matrix Operations:** Matrix-vector products with PyTree structures

### Matrix-Vector Products
Matrix-free operations for efficient computation:

- **Diagonal Extraction:** Compute diagonals without materializing full matrices
- **Dense Conversion:** Convert matrix-vector products to dense matrices when needed
- **Basis Operations:** Create and manipulate basis vectors for matrix operations

### Data Loading
Utilities for handling data in batches:

- **Batch Processing:** Functions for processing data loaders and iterables
- **Data Transformations:** Tools for splitting and transforming batch data
- **Reduction Operations:** Methods for reducing results across batches

### Adaptive Operations
Functions for flexible computation:

- **Batch Size Control:** Environment-variable controlled batch sizes
- **Data Type Management:** Configurable precision and data types
- **Precomputation:** Optional precomputation of repeated operations

### Flattening Operations
Tools for converting between PyTrees and flat arrays:

- **Flattening:** Convert PyTrees to flat arrays
- **Unflattening:** Reconstruct PyTrees from flat arrays
- **Function Wrapping:** Wrap functions to handle flattened inputs/outputs
